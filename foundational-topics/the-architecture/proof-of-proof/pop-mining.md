# PoP Mining

{% hint style="info" %}
### üìú **TL;DR:**

* Participants can secure the Hemi Network to Bitcoin and earn rewards by operating the PoP Miner application.
* There are two primary methods to run a PoP miner within the Hemi Network: [Web PoP Miner](../../../how-to-tutorials/using-hemi/pop-mining/web-based-pop-miner.md) and [CLI PoP Miner](../../../how-to-tutorials/using-hemi/pop-mining/setup-part-1.md).

## üåê **Overview**

* Mining within the Hemi Network involves a specialized process designed to intertwine the security of the Hemi Network with that of the Bitcoin blockchain.
* This is achieved through the operation of the PoP Miner application, which plays a pivotal role in this symbiotic security mechanism.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**

1. **Fetching Headers**: The PoP Miner retrieves network headers from the Bitcoin Finality Governor for Bitcoin blockchain publication.
2. **Transaction Construction**: The miner constructs Bitcoin transactions embedding aforementioned Hemi Network headers.
3. **Proof of Publication**:  Miners broadcast transactions through the Governor. These transactions are then integrated into Hemi‚Äôs consensus layer after being validated via the Bitcoin network, resulting in miner rewards.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Run a PoP Miner

There are two primary methods to run a PoP miner within the Hemi Network:

1. [**CLI Version:**](https://docs.hemi.xyz/how-to-tutorials/pop-mining/setup-part-1) The CLI (Command Line Interface) version of PoP mining is designed for long-term, continuous operation. It requires some technical knowledge for setup and maintenance but provides robust security and operational efficiency.&#x20;
2. [**Web-based Miner:**](../../../how-to-tutorials/using-hemi/pop-mining/web-based-pop-miner.md) The web-based PoP miner, built with WebAssembly (WASM), is lightweight, user-friendly, and requires no special hardware. It is ideal for users of all experience levels to test and run their own PoP miner. While it is not recommended for long-term operation, it is perfect for short-term experimentation and as an introduction to the more durable CLI version.

### üìù **Tips**

* üö´ **Single Key, Single Miner**: Using the same key for multiple PoP miner instances can lead to conflicts, as they may attempt to use the same Bitcoin UTXO simultaneously, causing operational issues.
* üóÇ **Purpose of** **`popm-address.json`**: This file serves as a secure storage for your generated keys, meant for reference. The actual Bitcoin key used by the PoP Miner is specified through an environment variable at the program's start.
* üîë **Unified Private Key**: Your single private key generates both a Bitcoin address and a Hemi address. The Hemi network automatically processes your public key from Bitcoin transactions, converting it into a Hemi address to receive payouts.
* ‚ö° **Bitcoin Testnet Dynamics**: Bitcoin testnet can undergo periods of rapid block generation due to block difficulty adjustments after inactive periods. This unusual pace can temporarily impact the timing and processing of payouts.

## üïµÔ∏è **Behind the Scenes**

* A Bitcoin Secure Sequencer (BSS) generates and broadcasts a new block.
* BSS nodes send the block header to Bitcoin Finality Governor (BFG) nodes.
* BFG nodes direct the header to PoP Miners.
* Miners create and send back signed Bitcoin transactions containing the header.
* BFG nodes push these transactions into the Bitcoin network.
* Once included in a Bitcoin block, BFG nodes generate PoP Transactions with proofs of Bitcoin inclusion.
* These transactions and Bitcoin headers are incorporated into a new Hemi block by a BSS node, updating the EVM with the latest Bitcoin state.
* Rewards are calculated and distributed to PoP Miners post-mining.
